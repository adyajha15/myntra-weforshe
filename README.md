# myntra-weforshe
This project is a modified version of the Myntra clone originally created by Md Sahil Amaan and team as part of their Masai School collaborative project. Our team (Adya, Aditi, and Chetanarupa) has extended this clone for the Myntra WE for SHE Hackathon, adding new features focused on sustainability, user engagement, and augmented reality.
